# Social Home core image — the household instance (§4).
#
# Entry point: ``python -m socialhome``.
# Ports: 8099 (HTTP/WebSocket) + 8124 (aiolibdatachannel signalling).
# Runtime: Python 3.14-slim + ffmpeg (video transcoding in SpacePosts
# + BazaarListing thumbnails) + libjpeg / libwebp (Pillow).
#
# Installs from a pre-built wheel — the SPA bundle in
# ``socialhome/static/`` is already baked in by the publish workflow's
# ``build`` job (or by a local ``pnpm --dir client run build`` +
# ``python -m build``). The runtime image therefore needs no node /
# pnpm at all, which keeps the multi-arch build cheap on QEMU.
#
# Published as ``ghcr.io/social-home-io/socialhome:{tag}`` by the
# ``docker-core`` job in .github/workflows/publish.yml.

# Pre-built wheel from the publish workflow's ``build`` job. The
# job captures the exact PEP 427 filename
# (``socialhome-{version}-py3-none-any.whl``) and passes it via
# ``--build-arg WHEEL`` so we keep the version-bearing filename
# uv requires. SPA bundle lives inside under ``socialhome/static/``.
# ``--system`` installs into the base image's site-packages directly
# (no venv); ``--no-cache`` keeps the layer size down.
