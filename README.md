# Social Home — `core`

The Python + Preact application that runs inside a household. Federates
peer-to-peer with other households, optionally subscribes to a Global
Federation Server (GFS) for public spaces. Runs as a Home Assistant
add-on or a standalone Docker container.

## Develop

### VS Code + Dev Container (recommended)

The repo ships a Dev Container (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)
that installs everything for you on first open: the Python project
in editable mode (`pip install -e .[dev]`), the pre-commit hooks,
pnpm, and the frontend deps under `client/`.

1. Open the repo in VS Code with the **Dev Containers** extension
   installed; pick **Reopen in Container** when prompted.
2. Wait for the container to build (a few minutes the first time).
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** (or **Terminal → Run Build Task…**) to
   launch **Dev: backend + frontend** — the backend boots in
   standalone mode against `/tmp/sh-dev`, and Vite starts at
   <http://localhost:5173> with `/api` + `/ws` proxied to the
   backend on `:8099`. Both ports are auto-forwarded.
4. The first request lands on `/setup`, where you pick the admin
   username + password.

The other tasks under **Terminal → Run Task…**:

- **Run backend (standalone)** — backend only.
- **Run frontend dev** — Vite only.
- **Clean test data (/tmp/sh-dev)** — wipe the throwaway data
  dir so the next backend launch drops you back at the wizard.
  Stop the backend first.

`.vscode/launch.json` includes a **Debug backend (standalone)**
config and a **Debug current pytest file** config (uses
`debugpy`).

### Manual setup

If you're not using the Dev Container, do the same one-time
setup:

```sh
pip install -e .[dev] && pre-commit install
cd client && pnpm install
```

Run the backend in standalone mode with a throwaway data dir under
`/tmp`. The first request lands on `/setup` so you can pick the admin
username + password through the wizard:

```sh
SH_MODE=standalone SH_DATA_DIR=/tmp/sh-dev python -m socialhome
```

In a second terminal, start the frontend dev server (Vite proxies
`/api` and `/ws` to `localhost:8099`):

```sh
cd client && pnpm run dev --host
```

Open the URL Vite prints (typically <http://localhost:5173>). Reset
the dev instance any time by stopping the backend and `rm -rf
/tmp/sh-dev` — the next start drops you back at the wizard.

Run the test suite with `pytest` (backend) and `pnpm exec vitest run`
(frontend, from `client/`).
