/**
 * SPA platform adapter — the frontend mirror of the backend's
 * `socialhome/platform/` (adapter + `Capability`) pattern.
 *
 * The backend rule is "consume Provider interfaces / `capabilities`,
 * never branch on `config.mode`". This module is the SPA equivalent: the
 * **data** lives in `store/instance` (`instanceConfig`, loaded from
 * `GET /api/instance/config`), and call sites read **intent-revealing
 * accessors** from here instead of hardcoding `'standalone'`/`'ha'`/
 * `'haos'` strings or capability literals all over the codebase.
 *
 * All helpers are plain functions that read the `instanceConfig` signal,
 * so calling them inside a component render stays reactive (the read is
 * tracked the same way `hasCapability` already was).
 *
 * The ingress transport (URL prefixing for HA Supervisor ingress) is a
 * separate, already-encapsulated concern — see `baseUrl.ts`
 * (`basePath` / `addBase` / `stripBase`) and `router/IngressLocationProvider`.
 * It isn't re-homed here to avoid churning every `addBase` import.
