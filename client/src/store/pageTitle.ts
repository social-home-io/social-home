 * Page title — shared signal driving the heading shown in the TopBar.

 * TopBar renders ``pageTitle.value`` so every page shows its label
 * inline with the search bar (saves one row of vertical space vs. an
 * h1 inside the page body).
 *
 * Static pages (Calendar, Shopping, Settings, …) pass a literal
 * string. Dynamic pages (the active task list's name, a space's
 * name) re-call :func:`useTitle` whenever the underlying value
 * changes — the hook updates the signal on every render so reactive
 * computations stay live.
