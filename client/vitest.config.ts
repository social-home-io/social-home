// On CI, cap the fork pool to roughly the number of *physical* cores.
// GitHub runners report hyperthreaded vCPUs, so vitest's default (one fork
// per reported CPU) over-subscribes the real cores. Under that contention the
// heavy full-page integration tests (e.g. DmThreadPage's cold render, which
// waits through a multi-step async load → render → layout-effect chain) get
// CPU-starved and their wall-clock crosses the in-test `waitFor` budget — a
// flake that only manifests on CI, never locally. Giving each running test
// more sustained CPU keeps those chains under budget. Half the reported CPUs
// is a safe approximation of the physical-core count; local runs are left at
// the vitest default (fast multi-core boxes don't have the problem).
