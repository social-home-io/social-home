"""Regression tests for the federation-demo log-audit helpers.

These pin the block-splitter + benign-needle invariants that
``cmd_verify`` uses to assert all four backends finished a clean run.
Two real bugs surfaced here:

1. ``_looks_like_exc_summary`` mis-classified standard Python logging
   records (``ERROR:logger:msg``) as exception-tail continuations,
   so the whole log collapsed into one big block and the audit
   couldn't see anything individually.
2. Several known-benign warning patterns (DTLS handshake timeouts on
   loopback, outbox terminal HTTP 410 drops, HTTPS-inbox transient
   failures during the inner-ring settle window) weren't in
   ``_LOG_BENIGN`` so they would have been (mis-)reported as audit
   failures if the splitter had been working.

The tests load the audit helpers directly from
``.claude/skills/federation-demo/harness.py`` — they're standalone
functions with no demo-runtime dependencies."""
