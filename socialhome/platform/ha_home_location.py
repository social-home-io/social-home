"""HA-sourced home-location persistence helper.

Both :class:`socialhome.platform.ha.HaAdapter` and
:class:`socialhome.platform.haos.HaosAdapter` learn the household's
GPS coordinates from HA Core's ``/api/config``. This helper is the
shared write-side: it compares the value HA reports to what's
already on the local ``instance_identity`` row, persists the new
value (4dp-truncated per §25) if different, and publishes
:class:`LocalHomeLocationUpdated` on change so the federation
service can fan it out to peers.

Read-only against HA: we never write back. HA Core stays the source
of truth.
