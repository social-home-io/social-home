"""Shared HA provider classes.

The provider Protocols defined in :mod:`socialhome.platform.adapter`
have one HA-shaped implementation each that both :class:`HaAdapter`
(Core) and :class:`~socialhome.platform.haos.HaosAdapter` (Supervisor
add-on) compose. The auth provider is the only piece that varies —
HAOS uses :class:`~socialhome.platform.haos.adapter.HaIngressAuthProvider`
which trusts the Supervisor-injected ``X-Remote-User-Name`` header before
falling back to the bearer flow.

Each provider holds a back-reference to its adapter so it can lazily
access ``adapter._client`` (only available after the adapter's
``on_startup`` has run) and ``adapter._options``.
