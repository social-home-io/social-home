"""Shared ICE-server / TURN-credential helpers.

The same coturn HMAC-credential scheme (REST API spec §6) is needed by
both the SPA's ``/api/calls/ice-servers`` endpoint (per-user
credentials, short TTL) and the server-to-server federation transport
(per-instance credentials, also short TTL). Extracted here so the two
call sites stay consistent and a future refactor — e.g. swapping
HMAC-SHA1 for SHA-256 — happens in one place.

This module is also the place to put any future ICE-server heuristics
(``iceTransportPolicy=relay`` toggle, dynamic STUN-server probing,
diagnostic "no TURN configured" warnings) so the wiring stays close
to its docs.
