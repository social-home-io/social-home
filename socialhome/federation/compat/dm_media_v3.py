"""Sub-v_3 fallback for DM media (image / video / file).

§319 paragraph 5 policy: **fallback**. A v_2 receiver doesn't know
how to render an ``image`` / ``video`` / ``file`` message and doesn't
expect the ``DM_MEDIA_BLOB`` follow-up event to land. Rather than
silently dropping the send (``skip``) or refusing the operation
(``force-upgrade``), we degrade the wire shape to a normal
``type='text'`` message whose content names the file the sender
intended to share — the receiver sees a useful "📎 cat.jpg — sender
needs to upgrade…" line in the thread and can ask the sender to
re-send once they're current.

User-facing consequence:

* **Sender on v_3** → recipient on v_2: the recipient's thread shows
  a single text bubble of the form "📎 ``<file_name>`` — your peer's
  household needs to update before they can share media." The
  sender's own bubble renders normally (image / video / file). The
  send isn't blocked; the operator's UI doesn't surface anything
  beyond the natural "peer behind" notice from the admin compat
  panel (issue #319 paragraph 1).
* **Sender on v_2** → recipient on v_3: the recipient knows the
  sender can't ship media yet — no rewrite happens here because
  v_2 senders never produce media events in the first place.

This file is the canonical reference shape for a fallback shim — see
:mod:`socialhome.federation.compat` for the discipline + how to add
a new one when v_4 ships.
