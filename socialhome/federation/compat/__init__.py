"""Per-version compatibility transforms for outbound federation payloads.

This subtree exists so the **main service code stays clean of
``if peer_supports(...) else legacy_shape``** branches. Every new
``proto_version`` bump that needs a real outbound rewrite (i.e. it
isn't fail-soft on the receiver side) lands as a new file here.

Adding a new compat shim:

1. Bump :data:`socialhome.domain.federation_capabilities.OURS` and add
   a named ``MIN_FOR_*`` constant on
   :class:`socialhome.domain.federation_capabilities.FederationCapability`.
2. Append a row to the version-history table in
   :doc:`docs/protocol/capabilities <docs/protocol/capabilities.md>`
   that names the §319-paragraph-5 policy (``skip`` / ``fallback`` /
   ``force-upgrade``).
3. Add a ``<feature>_v<N>.py`` file in this package that exports a
   :class:`OutboundTransform` (or matches the ``Transform`` Protocol
   below) and register it via :func:`register`.
4. Call :func:`transform_for_peer` from the outbound layer just before
   sending the event to a specific peer.

Dropping support for an old version is a single-file delete here —
the registry stops finding the shim, the helper becomes a no-op for
that event type, and the main service code never needs touching.

Issue #319 paragraph 5 ("Mixed-space degraded-shape policy per
feature") asks for the discipline this module enforces by
construction: each shim's docstring **must** name the picked policy
(``skip`` / ``fallback`` / ``force-upgrade``) and the user-facing
consequence.
