"""Shared space membership / role-guard primitives.

Space-scoped services (spaces, zones, bots, …) all gate writes on the
same two reads:

1. **Is the caller a member of this space?** — ``space_repo.get_member``,
   raise :class:`SpacePermissionError` if not.
2. **Does the caller hold a required role?** — same lookup, then compare
   ``member.role`` against an allowed set (``OWNER``/``ADMIN``/…).

Many call sites address the actor by *username* and must first resolve
it to a user id via the user repo (raising ``KeyError`` for an unknown
user). These three primitives — ``_member_or_raise``, ``_role_or_raise``,
``_actor_or_raise`` — are the recurring kernels; this mixin owns them so
each service's public guard methods (``_require_member`` /
``_require_admin_or_owner`` / …) become thin one-liners that keep their
own names, signatures, and error messages.

Behaviour-only mixin (``__slots__ = ()``): it reads the ``_spaces`` and
``_users`` slots the consuming service already declares, so it composes
with other mixins (e.g. ``BusPublisherMixin`` on ``SpaceZoneService``).
See :mod:`socialhome.services.bus_publisher` for why composable mixins
carry no slots.

Compare roles against the :class:`SpaceRole` enum (never bare strings) —
the caller passes the allowed set; this mixin only does the membership
read and the ``in`` check.
