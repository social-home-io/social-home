"""Voice-note transcription — runs ``adapter.stt`` over an OGG/Opus blob.

Voice notes ship from the SPA as OGG/Opus. The platform STT providers
all want raw PCM16 at the rate they were configured for (HA Whisper:
16 kHz mono). This service is the boundary that decodes the container,
resamples, and hands the result to ``adapter.transcribe_audio``.

Both legs of the voice-note flow use it:

* **Sender-side.** Right after the audio bubble is persisted (empty
  ``content``), :class:`DmService` calls
  :meth:`AudioTranscriptionService.transcribe` on the just-uploaded
  blob and, on a non-``None`` result, patches the row via
  ``update_message_content`` + emits ``DmMessageUpdated``.
* **Receiver-side.** When a remote audio message lands without a
  transcript, :class:`AudioTranscriptScheduler` polls for it and
  calls the same method to fill the gap locally.

Fail-silent: any failure (no STT capability, decode error, adapter
raise, empty transcription) returns ``None`` so the audio bubble
still plays for the user.
