"""Federation relay-policy gate (§Momentum-relay-policy).

Determines whether a hop-bearing event is allowed to land or relay.
Two negative signals stop the flow:

* The source instance is on the household-level
  :class:`HouseholdInstanceBan` list (set by the operator from the
  Settings → Federation page).
* There is at least one ``status='pending'`` row in
  ``content_reports`` against the author OR the specific moment id.
  The local moderation queue overrides federation fan-out — neither
  the local persist nor the relay-out runs while the report is open.

Per-user :table:`user_blocks` are intentionally NOT consulted here.
Personal block lists stay private to the social layer; tying them
to relay would couple two trust models and leak block-list shape
to every paired peer.

Hooked into both inbound (federation_inbound_service) and outbound
(moment_federation_outbound) so the rule is enforced at every
egress / ingress point.
