"""Delete media-dir files that no DB row references (orphans).

The per-delete cleanup paths (DM, gallery, posts, highlights, moments) catch
the common cases, but some files still leak — most notably media whose owning
row was removed by a *remote* federation event. This sweep is the backstop:
it lists the media dir, and deletes any file that

  1. is NOT referenced by any DB row (see ``AbstractMediaReferenceRepo``), AND
  2. is older than :data:`GRACE_SECONDS` (so in-flight uploads / freshly
     created rows whose commit races the sweep are never reaped), AND
  3. is NOT a transient DM intermediate (``*.preview.webp`` / ``*.part<NNNN>``
     / ``*.assembled*``) — those aren't in any ``media_url`` column and are
     owned by ``dm_gc``; sweeping them would clobber in-progress transfers.

Only top-level regular files are considered — sub-directories (the DM
``.partial/`` staging area, the async-transcode ``transcode_src/`` source
stash) are skipped entirely by :meth:`sweep_once`. The transcode source
stash is reaped by its own pass, :meth:`sweep_transcode_src_once`, which the
scheduler runs alongside the top-level sweep each tick.

Fail-soft: any per-file error is logged and skipped so one bad file never
aborts the pass.
