"""Shared visibility-lookup mixin for outbound federation services.

The per-pair user-visibility toggle in ConnectionDetail
(``PATCH /api/pairing/connections/{instance_id}/visible-users``) writes
into ``peer_user_visibility``. Outbound federation services that fan
user-scoped events to peers (presence, DMs, highlights, moments, …)
all need the same read: "which of our local users are hidden from this
specific peer?"

This module exposes that read as a small mixin so every service shares
one implementation. Subclasses:

* Accept ``visibility_repo`` as an optional constructor kwarg.
* Assign it to ``self._visibility_repo`` in ``__init__`` (the slot
  lives on the mixin so the service's own ``__slots__`` doesn't need
  to repeat it).
* Call ``await self.hidden_for_peer(peer_id)`` before each per-peer
  send and skip the send when the sender's ``user_id`` is in the
  returned set.

Shape is a ``frozenset[str]`` per peer so a service that fans one event
to many users (e.g. ``USERS_SYNC``, ``DM_HISTORY_CHUNK``) does one DB
read and filters with set membership. The companion shape — one read
per (peer, user) pair — would be N lookups for the same batch; we
prefer the bulk read.

Fail-soft: a missing repo (``None``) or a repo error returns the empty
set, i.e. default-visible. The contract matches the existing
``ProfileFederationOutbound._on_updated`` semantics — visibility lookup
must never block federation outbound on a transient infra failure.
