"""Instance metadata route — what mode are we in, what can the SPA show?

`GET /api/instance/config` is the SPA's first call on cold start. The
response carries the deployment mode, the adapter's capability set, and
the first-boot setup flag so the SPA knows whether to route the user
to `/setup` instead of `/login`.

Public path — no auth required, intentionally. The SPA needs this
*before* it has a token.
