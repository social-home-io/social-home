"""WebSocketManager — fan-out of in-process events to connected clients (§5.3).

The frontend opens a single WebSocket against ``/api/ws`` with its
bearer token. The manager keeps a per-user set of connections and
exposes:

* :meth:`broadcast_to_user` — fan to all of one user's sockets
  (e.g. their own browser + mobile + desktop tabs).
* :meth:`broadcast_to_users` — fan to a set of users
  (e.g. all members of a space when a post lands).
* :meth:`broadcast_all` — fan to every connected session
  (rare — used by admin maintenance broadcasts).

The manager has no knowledge of *which* events to send — that is the
job of :class:`socialhome.services.realtime_service.RealtimeService`,
which subscribes to domain events on the bus and translates them into
JSON frames the frontend understands.

Closing semantics: connections are tracked weakly — when a client
closes, the WS handler removes itself via :meth:`unregister`. Stale
sockets that fail to send are dropped on the next attempt rather than
raising, so a single dead client cannot block the rest of the fan-out.
