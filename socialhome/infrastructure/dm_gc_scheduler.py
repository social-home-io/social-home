"""Periodic GC for fully-left DM conversations (§23.47c) + media orphans.

Two responsibilities, both hourly:

1. **Conversation GC.** When every local member of a 1:1 / group DM
   has soft-left and no remote members are attached, the
   conversation is empty. ``hard_delete`` cascades through child
   tables (messages, reactions, delivery state, gap rows).
   Federated conversations are skipped by
   ``list_fully_left_conversation_ids`` — their lifecycle is owned
   by the federation peer.
2. **DM media orphan sweep.** v_3 introduces cross-household
   ``DM_MEDIA_BLOB`` chunks that the receiver writes to
   ``<msg_id>.preview.webp`` or ``<msg_id>.part<idx>`` under the
   local media root. If the matching ``conversation_messages`` row
   gets soft-deleted (sender retracted the DM, or the user left
   the convo and the conv GC ran above) or never landed at all
   (sender abandoned mid-flight), those files would otherwise
   live forever. This sweep enumerates the part / preview files
   and drops anything without a backing message row.
